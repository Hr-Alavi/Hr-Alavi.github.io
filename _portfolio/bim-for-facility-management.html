<p>This research project advances <strong>BIM-based approaches for facility management (FM)</strong>, improving how maintenance, condition assessment, and operational decision-making are supported by structured building information.</p>
<p>It emphasizes interoperability between BIM and FM processes through structured data models and workflows that reduce manual data handling and improve consistency over a building’s lifecycle.</p>
<p>The project contributes methods and prototypes that help translate building data into actionable maintenance insights.</p>

<h2>At a glance</h2>
