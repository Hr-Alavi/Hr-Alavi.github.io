<p>This project develops <strong>human-centric digital twins</strong> to support day-to-day building management decisions.</p>
<p>It integrates building information (e.g., BIM/asset data), operational data (e.g., sensors/BMS), and user/occupant inputs into a unified model that is understandable and actionable for facility teams.</p>
<p>Key outcomes include decision-support workflows for maintenance and comfort, and reusable data pipelines for deploying digital twin services across buildings.</p>
