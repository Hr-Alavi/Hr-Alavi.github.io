Hamidreza Alavi is a Senior Lecturer in Construction Informatics at [Oxford Brookes University](https://www.brookes.ac.uk/) and an Academic Affiliate at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). His research and teaching focus on artificial intelligence, machine learning, digital twins, and data-driven decision-making for the built environment, with applications in infrastructure management, construction automation, and facility and asset management.
Previously, he served as a [Research and Teaching Associate in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge](https://www.construction.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-hamidreza-alavi), where he continues to contribute to curriculum development and teaching. He designs and delivers modules on Building Information Modeling (BIM) and digital twin technologies, integrating real-world case studies with advanced computational and data-driven methods. He is a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA) and has extensive experience in innovative pedagogical approaches for engineering education.
Prior to joining Cambridge, he was an Associate Professor at the [Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC)](https://www.upc.edu/en), where he led research in BIM-based facility management, digital construction, and decision-support systems. He has played key roles in international and interdisciplinary research projects focused on advancing digitalisation and intelligence in the built environment.
His research has been widely published in high-impact journals and international conferences, and he serves as an Editorial Board Member of the [Smart and Sustainable Built Environment](https://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/journal/sasbe) journal. Through his work, he is committed to bridging research and education to develop intelligent, sustainable, and technology-driven solutions for the construction and infrastructure sectors.
